arduino-pov-display
===================

This repo is started as a way to house my first real Arduino project, the Arduino Persistence of Vision (POV) display. It functions like this:

Let's say you have a 3x3 pixel grid. You can easily make simple letters like the "T" in this example.

But, what if you only have one collumn?

You can divide your array into 3 separate collumns. Now, if you used LEDs instead of cells in a table, if you were to move the LEDs in a line, any you used a long exposure, you would get a picture that mimics a large display with only a single collumn of LEDs. Example coming soon.

So, if you program an Arduino to flash LEDs in a certain pattern and move the Ardunio with the long exposure, you get long exposure photographs of letters. 

The code for this project will be uploaded soon. This is just an introduction.
